RSAConsole
==========

This is a simple RSA prgram.<br \>
I used Miracl lib.<br \>

<h2>File List</h2>

These files is miracl lib. If you want to use the lib, maybe you can visit there github, or there website.<br \>
including:<br \>

miracl.h<br \>
mirdef.h<br \>
ms32.lib<br \>
mrcore.cpp (not used.)<br \>


These file was written by myself. It's very easy with the miracl lib.<br \>

main.cpp<br \>
rsa.cpp<br \>
rsa.h<br \>

<h2>Usage</h2>
It's very easy to use it.

First you must set a key size, which is recommand 2048.

Because 4096 is tooo slow!

The message that you want to encrypt should write in "msg.txt".

Then, follow the tips and finish the encryption.

When you finished, you can see some files in current dir.

enc.txt : This is the encryption file.

log.txt : Somethong about encryption. If there are some errors occured, maybe it is useful.

check.txt : To check if the encrypt is correct. If it is the same to the msg.txt, that's say it correct.
